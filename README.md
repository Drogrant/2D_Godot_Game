# 2D_Godot_Game

---- Basic 2D Game being made in Godot ----

I added some basic movement just using the arrow keys. The input is pretty simple, I will improve it later.

The character is a beautiful Black Square i drew with Gimp.

I took a nice sprite sheet of Link from the original Zelda to have some animations. If some day we have 
better sprites I will replace them. Then I created the walking animations and added a function to handle the
animations according to the movement.

I found this video useful to set up the animations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3flgK75Oz0
